One of the issues you will run into while building reusable components is the need to create
multiple variants of a component. For example, you may want to create a button
component that has different sizes, colors, and hover states.

You can actually use template literals to create a string of classes that
can be used to create these variants as seen below:

```tsx title="myapp/src/Button.tsx"
import * as React from "react";

export type ButtonProps {
  type: "primary" | "secondary";
  size: "small" | "medium" | "large";
  children: React.ReactNode;
}

export function Button({type, size, children}: ButtonProps) {
  return <button className={`
            ${type === "primary" ? "bg-blue-500 text-white"
            : "bg-gray-200 text-gray-800"}
            ${size === "small" ? "px-2 py-1 text-xs"
            : size === "medium" ? "px-4 py-2 text-sm"
            : "px-6 py-3 text-base"}`}>{children}</button>;
}

Button.displayName = "Button";
```

The above approach works but the problem here is that it can get
messy and hard to read when you have a lot of variants. This is where Tailwind
variants come in.

With Tailwind Variants, you can create a set of classes which can be
used to create different variants of a component.

So how do we do that? We'll use a simple example to demonstrate how to use
Tailwind Variants to create different variants of a component. In this
example, we will be using a button component that has different sizes and colors but
in your case, it might be different component, the same concept applies.

This example assumes you use React and have Typescript and TailwindCSS installed. If you
don't, you can check this [guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite) which shows you how to setup a
React project with Typescript and TailwindCSS using Vite.

If you use a different framework or library like Vue, you can still follow along as the
concept is the same.

Proceed to install tailwind variants by running the following command:

```bash
npm install tailwind-variants
```

Create a new component called `Button.tsx` and add the following code:

```tsx title="myapp/src/Button.tsx"
import * as React from "react";
import { tv } from "tailwind-variants";

type ButtonProps = {
  color?: "primary" | "danger";
  size?: "xs" | "sm" | "md";
  disabled?: boolean;
  children: React.ReactNode;
};

const buttonVariants = tv({
  base: "text-white rounded-lg transition border duration-300 ease-in-out",
  variants: {
    color: {
      neutral:
        "bg-neutral-900 hover:bg-transparent border-neutral-900 hover:text-neutral-900 focus:bg-neutral-100 focus:text-neutral-900 focus:border-transparent",
      primary:
        "bg-blue-500 hover:bg-transparent border-blue-500 hover:text-blue-500 focus:bg-blue-100 focus:text-blue-500 focus:border-transparent",
      danger:
        "bg-red-500 hover:bg-transparent border-red-500 hover:text-red-500 focus:bg-red-100 focus:text-red-500 focus:border-transparent",
    },
    size: {
      xs: "py-2 px-4 text-xs",
      sm: "py-2.5 px-5 text-sm",
      md: "py-3 px-6 text-base",
    },
    disabled: {
      true: "opacity-50 cursor-not-allowed pointer-events-none",
    },
  },
  defaultVariants: {
    color: "neutral",
    size: "sm",
  },
});

export function Button({
  color,
  size,
  disabled,
  children,
}: ButtonProps) {
  const classes = buttonVariants({ color, size, disabled });

  return (
    <button className={classes}>{children}</button>;
  );
}

Button.displayName = "Button";
```

<CodeOutput>
  <div class="p-5 bg-white flex items-center space-x-3">
    <button class="text-white rounded-lg transition border duration-300 ease-in-out bg-blue-500 hover:bg-transparent border-blue-500 hover:text-blue-500 focus:bg-blue-100 focus:text-blue-500 focus:border-transparent py-2 px-4 text-xs">
